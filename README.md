# 5-day-weather-forcast

About.
This application is supposed to allow users to search for the 5 day weather forcast for any givien city.

Description.
The application allows the user to enter the city of their choice and see what the weather will be.

Challenges
Some challenges I faced were difficulties getting the website to look the way I wanted as well as getting the button to actually work. Also, getting the API to work correctly and display the weather.

Future Development
For future development, I want to make the website look better as well as get the button to work. Once this happens I would like to implement an API that will let people know if activities are still going on if there is bad weather in the area.

Motivation
My motivation was to get a good grade on this class assignment while trying to implement what I have learned in class.

Success
I didn't have many successes in this project but I know I can come back and fix it as I learn more.

Contributors
Myself as well as help from a YouTube video about weather forecast websites.
